# Analysis

## Day 6

My code is atrocious, and this took me way too long. Unproud.
Complex numbers are a great trick though, and I'm glad I learned about them.

## Day 7

Much better

## Day 11

I love this problem; it's a quintessential example of how to use a hashtable in
an interview question.

## Day 12

Had to get 2 hints:

- can look at nodes individually for perimeter
- count corners (I had previously pruned trying this, although I did think of it)

Lessons learned:

- You can count perimeter with individual nodes
- count vertices instead of edges, although I doubt I will ever get this again
- BFS is useful to have pre-written
- complex numbers are once again OP

## Day 13

Originally thought it was DP but I was very very wrong
